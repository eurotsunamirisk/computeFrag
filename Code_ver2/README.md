# Guide to accessing the empirical fragility calculation Code

### A code for computing empirical fragility curves based on generalized linear regression models. 
<br>This code provides an ensemble of the fragility curves and their corresponding confidence bands for a set of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE) damage states. <br>To use this code, you should cite the following manuscript:
<br> Jalayer, F., Ebrahimian, H., Trevlopoulos, K., and Bradley, B. (2022)doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2022-206 
<br> [Empirical tsunami fragility modelling for hierarchical damage levels](https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2022-206). 

The parameters of the empirical fragilities associated with different damage level are estimated jointly using Bayesian inference by employing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo Simulation (MCMC) scheme.

### The main script, _main_script_Bayesian_fragility_model.m_, expects the following inputs:
<br>**Filename:** The filename of a csv file containing two columns, one for the intensity measure and one for the damage state. 
<br>**output_folder:** The folder that the outputs will be stored.
<br>**excel_filename:** The name of the Excel file name for storing the fragility data. 
<br>**D:** Definition of the damage levels (e.g. 0:2 showing that we have 3 damage levels 0, 1 and 2).
<br>**dvec_alpha0, dvec_alpha1:** The increments of the vectors of the two logistic regression parameters.
<br>**do_MCMC_M1:** Perform MCMC for fragility model 1 (for the models, please see the corresponding paper) (if =0, do not perform MCMC and read MCMC data from output_folder; if =1, do MCMC)
<br>**do_MCMC_M2:** Perform MCMC for fragility model 2 (for the models, please see the corresponding paper) (if =0, do not perform MCMC and read MCMC data from output_folder; if =1, do MCMC)
<br>**do_MCMC_M3:** Perform MCMC for fragility model 3 (for the models, please see the corresponding paper) (if =0, do not perform MCMC and read MCMC data from output_folder; if =1, do MCMC)
<br>**COVprior_M1:** Coefficient of variation for the prior parameters of model 1 (please see the corresponding paper) 
<br>**COVprior_M2:** Coefficient of variation for the prior parameters of model 2 (please see the corresponding paper) 
<br>**COVprior_M3:** Coefficient of variation for the prior parameters of model 3 (please see the corresponding paper) 
<br>**dIM, IM_max:** The step and the maximum absolute value for the IM vector.
<br>**confidence:** The number of standard deviations defining the confidence interval for the robust fragility (fixed for all the DS).
<br>**do_modelClassSelection:** if =0, do not perform model class selection; if =1, do model class selection (please see the corresponding paper) 

### The outputs of the code are stored in the excel files defined by the name _excel_filename_. 
**The output format is described in the file [ReadMe file for fragility data](https://github.com/soltanisgeo/readme/blob/main/README-FragilityData.md)**
