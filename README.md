######Graphical representation of damage thresholds, D, and damage states, DS

<br>
<br>

This code provides an ensemble of the fragility curves and their corresponding confidence bands for a set of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE) damage states (DS), where DS<sub>i</sub>: i=0,N<sub>DS</sub>. The fragility is defined as the probability of damage D exceeding the threshold D<sub>i</sub> for damage state DS<sub>i</sub> and is denoted as P(D>Di|IM).  The set of damage levels (D<sub>i</sub>, i=0,N<sub>DS</sub>) mark the thresholds of damage states (DS<sub>i</sub>). 
<br>
The parameters of the empirical fragilities associated with different damage level are estimated jointly using Bayesian inference by employing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo Simulation (MCMC) scheme. 
<br>
<br>

## The **inputs** of the code are the following:
<br>**InputFileName:** The filename of a csv file containing two columns, one for the intensity measure and one for the damage state. In this example, it is the file IM_and_DS.csv.
<br>**NDS:** The number of the damage states.
<br>**dIM, IM_max:** The step and the maximum absolute value for the IM vector.
<br>**dvec_alpha0, dvec_alpha1:** The increments of the vectors of the two logistic regression parameters.
<br>**confid:** The number of standard deviations defining the confidence interval for the robust fragility (fixed for all the DS).

<br>
<br>

## The **outputs** of the code are the following:
<br>**sample_theta_model:** Ns=500 samples generated from the posterior joint probability distribution for logistic fragility model parameters (e.g., a total of 10 parameters for 5 DS, 2 parameters/DS) using the MCMC procedure. 
<br>**rfragility:** Robust (the mean fragility among the Ns=500 realizations for each DS) fragility curve with the row showing the IM vector and a number of columns equal to the number of DS.
<br>**sfragility:** The standard deviation of the Ns=500 fragility curve samples (the same structure as rfragility). For having the fragility with a confidence, you should do this operation: rfragility+confid*sfragility (e.g., if confid=±1, we have 16th and 84th percentiles, if confid=±2, we have 2nd and 98th percentiles).
<br>**etaIMc:** The median of rfragility (i.e., the IM value corresponding to 50% probability from rfragility). It is a vector with its length equal to the number of DS.
<br>**betaIMc:** The equivalent logarithmic standard deviation of the rfragility (i.e., half of the logarithmic distance between IM values corresponding to 84% and 16% probabilities, respectively). It is a vector with its length equal to the number of DS.

### To execute the code, run the script computeFrag.py
<br>
**Requirements:** MATLAB, numpy, pandas

## Docker
You may also run the code as a standalone docker application. To do so, first pull the image from [docker hub]( https://hub.docker.com/r/eurotsunamirisk/bayesian-fragility-standalone-app). Create a folder for the input and the outputs of the code. For example, create the folder
```sh
C:\input_output\ (windows)
```
or
```sh
/home/user/input_output (linux)
```
Place in that folder the input file (e.g. the file _building_class_1.csv_ from the code’s repo) and execute the application using one of the following commands depending on your operating system:

```sh
docker run --rm -v C:\input_output:/tmp bayesian-fragility-standalone-app /tmp/building_class_1.csv 
```
```sh
docker run --rm -v /home/user1/input_output:/tmp bayesian-fragility-standalone-app /tmp/building_class_1.csv
```
